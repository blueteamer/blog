For several years I was using Wordpress for my blog. This year I wanted to get rid of it and try something new. 

## This is the way 
In my new job role I learned the joy and beauty of Markdown. We are heavily using Markdown for documentation in combination with automation. As Markdown is way easier to process by automation tools its the way to go. 

After I learned that you can host a complete blog on Github, my first thought was: "Give it a try." And here we are. 

I will probably write about the migration from Wordpress to a Github hosted blog powered by Hugo. 

## Coming soon 
So, what can you expect on my new blog? There will be various topics I want to cover. First of all, it still will be a "Note to myself" container, where I will save stuff I was searching and it took me some time to get all info together.
