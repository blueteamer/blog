This post provides an overview of shortcuts which I use most of the time. Anyways, this is more of an heads up for me to spare me some time instead of searching the same stuff over and over again. 

### Open Quick Switcher 
```
Ctrl + O
```
This will open the quick switcher menu from which you can select different items, settings and commands within Obsidian. 

### Create a new note 
```
Ctrl + N
```
This will create a new note. 

### Save the current note 
```
Ctrl + S 
```
Like in many other applications, this key combination will save the current progress of your file. 

### Open command pallet 
```
Ctrl + P
```
Similar to opening the quicklink menu but scoped to the commands, only. 

### Searching 
```
Ctrl + F
```
Search in the current file. 

```
Ctrl + Shift + F
```
Search in all files within the current vault. 

### Navigation with keyboard 
```
Ctrl + Alt + :leftkey
```
Navigate back. 

```
Ctrl + Alt + :rightkey
```
Navigate forth. 

### Views 
```
Ctrl + E 
```
Toggle between editing mode and preview mode. 

### Slash edit 
```
/
```
Use the slash symbol anywhere in a file while writing to have Obsidian open a menu from which you can select actions like inserting templates. 
Needs to be activated in the settings.
