For several years I have been using Wordpress for my blog. This year I wanted to get rid of it and try something new: Github with Hugo.

## This is the way 
In my new job role, I learned the joy and beauty of Markdown. We are heavily relying upon Markdown for documentation in combination with automation. As Markdown is way easier to process by automation tools, it's the way to go. 

After I learned that you can host an entire blog on Github using Markdown to write the posts, my first thought was: "Give it a try." And here we are. 

I will probably write about the migration from Wordpress to a Github-hosted blog powered by Hugo later. 

## Coming soon 
So, what can you expect from my new blog? There will be various topics I want to cover. First of all, it will still be a "Note to myself" container, where I will save stuff I was searching for, which took me some time to get all the information together.
