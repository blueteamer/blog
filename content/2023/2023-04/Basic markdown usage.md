### Formatting 

```
# Heading 1 (don't use that in your post, instead start with a level 2 heading)
## Heading 2 
### Heading 3 

**Bold** 
*Italic* 
***Italic Bold***

- list 
- list
- list 

1. first item
1. second item 
1. third item 

- [x] checked task
- [ ] unchecked task

> Quotes

![Name of an Image](/assets/images/nameoftheimage.jpg "Label the image") 

Some text with important content[^fn1]. This content needs to be cited. 
... 
[^fn1]: Here will be the footnote content

### A bulletlist with checked and unchecked items
- [x] This is a task
- [ ] Unchecked tasks 
- [ ] another unchecked task 
- [x] checked tasks

### A quote of clear and present danger 
> In times of great danger, there will always be someone who's bringing up a quote. 
> \-- Abraham Lincoln, 1998
