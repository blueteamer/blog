# Who are you? 
Well, I have no fecking idea who you are. But I can tell you a little bit about me. 
I'm the creator of **noizy.cloud**. That's it. 

The main reason, why I'm writing this blog is, because I won't ever remember everything I've been reading. And this blog shall help me find some of the stuff a little bit easier instead of googling every topic a thousand times. 

So, I hope some of that content will be helpful for you as well. If not, sorry about that. 

So long...
